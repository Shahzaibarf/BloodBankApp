## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```
### Available Scripts
Inside the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

- The page auto-reloads whenever you make changes to the code.
- Any linting issues will appear in the console.
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This allows for continuous testing during development.

For more details, check out the running tests documentation.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production and outputs the files to the build folder. The production build is optimized and minified for the best performance.

- React is bundled in production mode, and filenames include content hashes.
- After building, the app is ready for deployment.
For more information, refer to the deployment documentation.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning**: This is a permanent operation. Once you run eject, it cannot be undone!

If you need full control over the configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can run this command. It copies all configuration files into your project, allowing direct edits. All other commands will continue to work, but they will reference the new configurations.

You don't need to use this unless you want deeper customization beyond what's provided by Create React App.
